(“Medcorder”, “we”, “our”, or “us”). By downloading, accessing or using the Service, or by clicking a button or checking a box marked “I Agree” (or something similar), you signify that you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by these Terms of Service (this “Agreement”) and to the collection and use of your information as set forth in our Privacy Policy, whether or not you are a registered user of our Service. Medcorder reserves the right to modify these terms and will provide notice of these changes as described below. This Agreement applies to all visitors, users, and others who access the Service (“Users”).</p><p>Please read this Agreement carefully to ensure that you understand each provision. This agreement contains a mandatory individual arbitration and class action/jury trial waiver provision that requires the use of arbitration on an individual basis to resolve disputes, rather than jury trials or class actions.</p><h2>1. OUR SERVICE</h2><p>Medcorder provides patients (“Patients”) the opportunity to record conversations with their medical professionals to share with their friends and family.</p><h3>1.1. ELIGIBILITY</h3><p>This is a contract between you and Medcorder. You must read and agree to this Agreement before using the Service. If you do not agree, you may not use the Service. You may use the Service only if you can form a binding contract with Medcorder, and only in compliance with this Agreement and all applicable local, state, national, and international laws, rules and regulations. Any use or access to the Service by anyone under 13 is strictly prohibited and in violation of this Agreement. The Service is not available to any Users previously removed from the Service by Medcorder.</p><h3>1.2. LIMITED LICENSE</h3><p>Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, you are hereby granted a non-exclusive, limited, non-transferable, freely revocable license to use the Service for your personal, noncommercial use only and only as permitted by the features of the Service. Medcorder reserves all rights not expressly granted herein in the Service and the Medcorder Content (as defined below). Medcorder may terminate this license at any time for any reason or no reason.</p><h3>1.3. NON-PROFESSIONAL USE</h3><p>The Service is intended for use by Patients in their personal capacities to communicate information about their visits with their Doctors to their friends and family. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, you may not use the Service if you are a medical professional using the Service in your professional capacity, including (without limitation) sending diagnostic information to your patients or coordinating medical care with other medical professionals. If you are a medical professional, you may only use the Service either as a Patient sending information to your friends and family or as a friend or family member of a Patient. Any use of the Service by medical professionals in their professional capacities is a violation of this Agreement and will result in the automatic termination of the license included in Section 1.2 and the medical professional’s access to the Service.</p><h3>1.4. USER ACCOUNTS</h3><p>Your account on the Service (your “User Account”) gives you access to the services and functionality that we may establish and maintain from time to time and in our sole discretion. We may maintain different types of User Accounts for different types of Users. By connecting to Medcorder with a third-party service, you give us permission to access and use your information from that service as permitted by that service, and to store your log-in credentials for that service.</p><p>You may never use another User’s User Account without permission. When creating your User Account, you must provide accurate and complete information, and you must keep this information up to date. You are solely responsible for the activity that occurs on your User Account, and you must keep your User Account password secure. We encourage you to use “strong” passwords (passwords that use a combination of upper and lower case letters, numbers and symbols) with your User Account. You must notify Medcorder immediately of any breach of security or unauthorized use of your User Account. Medcorder will not be liable for any losses caused by any unauthorized use of your User Account.</p><p>You may control your User profile and how you interact with the Service by changing the settings in your settings page. By providing Medcorder your email address you consent to our using the email address to send you Service-related notices, including any notices required by law, in lieu of communication by postal mail. We may also use your email address to send you other messages, such as changes to features of the Service and special offers. If you do not want to receive such email messages, you may opt out or change your preferences in your settings page. Opting out may prevent you from receiving email messages regarding updates, improvements, or offers.</p><h3>1.5. SERVICE RULES</h3><p>You agree not to engage in any of the following prohibited activities: (i) using the Service in your professional capacity as a medical professional; (ii) copying, distributing, or disclosing any part of the Service in any medium, including without limitation by any automated or non-automated “scraping”; (iii) using any automated system, including without limitation “robots,” “spiders,” “offline readers,” etc., to access the Service in a manner that sends more request messages to the Company servers than a human can reasonably produce in the same period of time by using a conventional on-line web browser (except that Company grants the operators of public search engines revocable permission to use spiders to copy publicly available materials from the Company Site for the sole purpose of and solely to the extent necessary for creating publicly available searchable indices of the materials, but not caches or archives of such materials); (iv) transmitting spam, chain letters, or other unsolicited email; (v) attempting to interfere with, compromise the system integrity or security or decipher any transmissions to or from the servers running the Service; (vi) taking any action that imposes, or may impose at our sole discretion an unreasonable or disproportionately large load on our infrastructure; (vii) uploading invalid data, viruses, worms, or other software agents through the Service; (viii) collecting or harvesting any personally identifiable information, including account names, from the Service; (ix) using the Service for any commercial solicitation purposes; (x) impersonating another person or otherwise misrepresenting your affiliation with a person or entity, conducting fraud, hiding or attempting to hide your identity; (xi) interfering with the proper working of the Service; (xii) accessing any content on the Service through any technology or means other than those provided or authorized by the Service; or (xiii) bypassing the measures we may use to prevent or restrict access to the Service, including without limitation features that prevent or restrict use or copying of any content or enforce limitations on use of the Service or the content therein.</p><h3>1.6. CHANGES TO THE SERVICE</h3><p>We may, without prior notice, change the Service; stop providing the Service or features of the Service, to you or to Users generally; or create usage limits for the Service. We may permanently or temporarily terminate or suspend your access to the Service without notice and liability for any reason, including if in our sole determination you violate any provision of this Agreement, or for no reason. Upon termination for any reason or no reason, you continue to be bound by this Agreement.</p><h3>1.7. DISPUTES WITH OTHER USERS</h3><p>You are solely responsible for your interactions with other Users. We reserve the right, but have no obligation, to monitor disputes between you and other Users.
